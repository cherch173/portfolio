### I'm **Brian**.
I'm a **software engineer** and **full stack web developer** coming from a background in the Music Industry as both a performing artist and a music publisher. 

I've been fortunate enough to tour all over this beautiful planet with tremendous artistic and creative company, helped to soundtrack titles and trailers for several major video game franchises such as _Grand Theft Auto_, _Fallout_, the _EA Sports_ catalog (_FIFA_, _Madden_), _NBA 2k_, _Guitar Hero_, founded a few startups, curated a few festivals and somehow got endorsed by _Gibson_ & _Telefunken_ along the way. 

As a Dev? I'm constantly coding. 

I've developed and deployed several full stack web applications using a diverse array of tech stacks, methodologies, languages and frameworks -- I'm building and/or working on something new every day.
